// gallery" and click on the colors. Note the URL and the component
// are the same as before but now we see them inside a modal
// on top of the old screen.

  // We can also use "location state" to tell the app the user
  // wants to go to `/img/2` in a modal, rather than as the
  // main page, keeping the gallery visible behind it.
  //
  // Normally, `/img/2` wouldn't match the gallery at `/`.
  // So, to get both screens to render, we can save the old
  // location and pass it to Switch, so it will think the location
  // is still `/` even though its `/img/2`.
